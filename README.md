## --- Indentations ---

> Python DOES NOT ignore whitespace


## --- Operators ---
* 4/3 = 1.333...
* 4//3 = 1, Using // in operations will round down your division no matter the decimal
* round(4/2.3) = 2 and round(4/3) = 1, round will either round up or down depend on the answers 
* 24 % 5 = 4, this gives you back the remainder of a division quotent
* 2 ** 4 = 16, this means to the power of, ex - 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16

* Using +=, countup = 12, countup += 1, countup = 13, using += will add 1 to the variable - likewise -= will subtract,  *= multiply and /= divide...

#### <span style='color:red;'>NOTE:  /= with give your answer a float (decimal) output. to rid this you can round() the answer</span>

```python
#For exmaple...

divide = 20
divide /= 4
5.0 #answer

#rid the decimal as so,
divide = 20
divide /= 4
round(divide)
5 #answer

#OR

divide = 20
divide /= 4
divide = round(divide)
divide
5 #answer
```

## --- Concatanation ---

```python
"Dave " + "Liebherr" = 'David Liebherr'
```

## --- Comparision Operators ---
* returns a boolen

```python
12 == 11 #False
13 == 13 #True
13 != 12 #True (! means NOT, so in this case 13 IS NOT equal to 12, which is true)
13 != 13 #False
12 > 11 # True
112 > 1231 = #False
#<=, >= AS WELL
```

## --- NOTE ---

True and False must start with an uppercase letter

``` python
is_true = True
is_false = False
```
